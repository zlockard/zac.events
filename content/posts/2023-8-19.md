{{<moviesummary title=`Alien Private Eye` length=`95` year=`1989`>}}
Aliens have long integrated themselves among the human population to the point that they are physically indistinguishable, except for their uniquely pointed ears; a physical trait they go to great lengths to hide or have surgically altered in order to fully blend into human society. Lemro, an alien, has found his calling on earth working as a private investigator.
<br/><br/>
One day a beautiful and mysterious woman visits his office and shares the story of a mysterious disc shaped artifact which has the potential to destroy the human race, begging for Lemro's help in preventing such devastation. Initially uncertain if he should take the case, Lemro quickly finds himself embroiled in an intergalactic drug smuggling ring hellbent on turning every human into a mindless junkie. Putting his investigative - and martial arts skills - to the ultimate test, Lemro begins a deadly fight to smash the drug smuggling operation while racing against time to unlock the secret of the mysterious disc before it is too late.
